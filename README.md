 * 👋 Hi, I’m danhuaflx-56
 * 🍎 My main interests are physics and aviation
 * ✈️ I mainly study Airbus series aircraft such as the A320 and I am working on a “virtual type rating” for this family of aircraft, including the a319, a320, and a321, as well was the NEO, LR, and XLR variants
 * ✏️ For physics, I do competitions
 * 🔢 I am also studying math that general relativity is based on
 * 🪐 My current project focuses leverages my most advanced knowledge of math and physics (secret project)

**More about me:**
Currently a student, though I do spend a lot of my time grinding for the F=ma competition and I also like to study aviation during my free time. Usually I play Microsoft Flight Simulator with the Fenix A32X aircraft, though I do have some experience with other aircraft. I mainly have studied through various Youtube videos from real-world pilots so I am quite familiar with some real-world procedures (so hopefully I know what I'm talking about.) Furthermore, I also rely on some official documents such as the Airbus A320 Flight Crew Training Manual and Flight Crew Operating Manual. I started flight simulation around 2019, though it was until somewhere around 2021-2022 where I really started to learn aviation and work through contents for a PPL and ATPL courses. Of course, I'm not a real pilot, though I do plan on getting a PPL sometime next year.

As for my mathematics and physics background, I started conceptual physics roughly around 2021 and learnt the contents of AP physics 1 in 2022. I also learnt calculus at that same time, and I am planning on finishing Multivariable Calculus 3 + Linear Algebra soon. After that, I plan on doing Ordinary Differential Equations, some sort of Analysis, and the basics of Topology, and eventually differential geometry. Although I am concurrently studying almost all of these classes, it would be best to consider my mathematics knowledge to up only up to Multivariable Calculus, as I am strongest in this subject.
